    Buyer Fatigue Despite Positive Trade News 55
The White House announced its first official trade deal with the U.K. last week. The agreement provided U.K. steel
and aluminum reciprocal tariff exemptions and lowered British car imports to 10% from 25% for the first 100,000
vehicles. In return, the U.K. agreed to purchase Boeing jets, waive U.S. beef imports (previously at 20%), and reduce
levies on ethanol. The agreement fell short of a full-blown trade deal, but negotiations are ongoing, and most
importantly, it marked an important step in the right direction for trade policy. On that note, Treasury Secretary
Scott Bessent met with his Chinese counterpart over the weekend in Switzerland, marking the first public trade
discussion between the two countries. Heading into the meeting, Bessent voiced optimism for a “de-escalation” in
trade tensions with China, while President Trump posted on social media that an 80% tariff on China “seems right,”
encouraging China to “open up its market to the U.S.” The weekend meeting seemed to go well as both sides agreed
to a 90-day tariff reprieve, with the U.S. reducing its tariff to 30% from 145% and China cutting its levies to 10% from
125%.
    The transition from tariff rates, retaliation, and ultimately to trade deals is an important sequence for the recovery
in U.S. equity markets. And while we welcome the recent progress and administration’s ability to bring countries to
the negotiating table, there are still a lot of wrinkles to iron out on the trade front before President Trump’s 90-day
reciprocal tariff pause expires (we would not be surprised if the pause gets extended given the current deal count).
We also learned last week that positive trade headlines alone may not be enough to keep buyers engaged in this
recovery. The lack of investor response could partially be due to the likelihood of the 10% universal tariff rate being
maintained.
